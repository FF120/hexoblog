The graph and chart describe some basic information about UK both as a tourist destination and tourist exporter and which countries appeared to be more popular among British residents over a span of 2 decades from 1979 to 1999.

From the graph, we can see that the numbers of UK visitors going abroad and overseas tourists to Britain both ascended steadily, with the former well surpassing the latter in terms of the increase margin. In the meantime, among all the other countries in the world, Britons were apparently more inclined to visit their European neighbors.

From the graph, we learn that the numbers of visitors going out and coming in in 1979 were very close, both around 10 million. In the following 20 years, however, the gap kept expanding and it reached the peak in 1999, when overseas visitors amounted to 26 million and the number of UK travelers abroad doubled it.

The bar chart reveals that that the favorite tourist destinations for British residents in 1999 were mostly some traditional European resorts, such as Turkey, Greece, Spain, and France. The last two countries were especially appealing, both attracting 10 million or so British visitors, far exceeding the numbers to the other three countries. In addition, the United States, as the No. 1 power in the world, was also quite attractive to Britons.
